# Entity-Icons

This is a resource meant for people who make stuff for minecraft

I made entity icons 

So far there are all mob icons
I intend to add other entities as well, but there is only mobs currently.

There are 2 designs

## 8x8

## 16x16

------

There are sprite pages for resolutions 8x8, 16x16, 64x64, and 256x256

If you make something with this you should tell me because I think it'd be cool to see

alr yeah cool
